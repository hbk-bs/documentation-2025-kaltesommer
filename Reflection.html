       This documentation reflects on my experiences and learnings from the Digital Communication course at HBK Braunschweig, led by Fabian Morón Zirfas. Over the semester, I engaged in various projects that challenged me to think creatively and technically about digital media.
      This semester provided a valuable opportunity to expand my understanding of digital communication while also engaging with a wide range of creative and technical challenges. The course encouraged me to explore new ideas, test unfamiliar concepts, and push the boundaries of my own practice. Through the different assignments I not only developed specific skills, but also reflected on how creative work and technical knowledge can complement one another.
The projects I found most engaging were the fashion AI and the graphic novel. Both gave me the freedom to experiment with unconventional methods while also improving my coding abilities. These projects stood out because they combined conceptual exploration with hands-on problem solving, which made the process both demanding and rewarding. Although each assignment had its own unique character, they all demonstrated the diversity of approaches within digital communication. At the same time, I often felt limited by my lack of prior programming knowledge. There were moments when I wished I had entered the program with a stronger background in coding, which would have allowed me to approach the technical side with greater confidence. Despite these challenges, I appreciated that we were still able to create projects that were imaginative and meaningful.
Another important aspect of this semester was noticing how my perspective on coding gradually shifted. At first, I was unsure whether I wanted to pursue this skill further, but as I became more familiar with the logic of code, I found myself enjoying the process. The more I learned, the more creative possibilities opened up.
A strong example of my learning process can be seen in this documentation. Comparing my work from last year with this year’s, I can clearly recognize my growth. Compared to last year, I also felt more at ease with the assignments. This may have been due to greater personal interest in the topics or to a more balanced workload. Finally, I improved (and continue to improve) my ability to manage deadlines and structure my workflow, which I consider equally valuable for future projects. I am very grateful for this experience and would like to express my thanks.<br></br>
